# One in the Chamber

One in the Chamber (OITC) is a plugin that is a spinoff of the COD minigame in which the player had a gun with 1 bullet,
but it took one shot to kill. In the Minecraft version of the game, each player is given a Wooden Sword and a Bow with 1 Arrow.
If a player shoots someone with the bow, it kills the other player instantly and gets refunded an arrow. If you miss, you have to use the
Wooden Sword to get the kill.

## Setup

Setup is quite simple with the game, just use `/oa` to see the OITC Admin commands. Then, a player can join a game that is ready with `/oitc`.
All you need for the plugin to work is the jar file and no extra dependencies are required.  

To use the plugin, you must be using Spigot in 1.16.5
